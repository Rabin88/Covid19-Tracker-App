# Covid-19 Tracker App

This is a simple COVID-19 live update tracker application build during Covid-19 pandemic. This application displays the current number of confirmed positive and death cases. The user will be able to view the live update by selecting the country filed in the application.

 When COVID-19 was rising globally, many individuals were keen to know the daily update regarding corona cases. Therefore, I was appealed to build this application so that everyone could easily access the live cases without any hassle. At the same time, while building application I learned the way REST API works while fetching live data using Nodejs.
